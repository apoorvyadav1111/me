# ReadME
This is a personal website for oneself. 
- This is made using ReactJS, Bulma and a help from fellow engineer.
- One need to update resume.json for making it for self.
- You can head to https://github.com/jcoelho93/personal-website repo for original work. 
However, If you want to use Education section and fetch medium articles as your articles, please use this repo.

I will be updating this repo with more modules to add themes for your customization such that one without any react and Bulma knowledge can customize it as well.

Thanks,
Apoorv
